You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n where n is the total number of students in the class. The class teacher tries to select a group of students so that all the students remain happy.
The ith student will become happy if one of these two conditions is met:
The student is selected and the total number of selected students is strictly greater than nums[i].
The student is not selected and the total number of selected students is strictly less than nums[i].
Return the number of ways to select a group of students so that everyone remains happy.

class Solution {
    public int countWays(List<Integer> nums) {
        Collections.sort(nums);
        int n=nums.size(), i=0, j=0, res=0, s;
        for(i=-1;i<n;i++)
            if(i+1==0 || nums.get(i)<i+1)
                if(i+1==n || (i+1<n && nums.get(i+1)>i+1))
                    res++;
        return res;
    }
}
